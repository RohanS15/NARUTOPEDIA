            <li><strong>Sarutobi Hiruzen</strong><br>
              Sandaime Hokage became Hokage at a very young age. He was chosen as Hokage over another talented ninja named Danzou.<br>
              Sarutobi Hiruzen was known as the Professor, a ninja with extraordinary skill and knowledge of jutsu.<br>
              He would later pass on his knowledge to his students Jiraiya, Tsunade and Orochimaru.<br>
              Jiraiya would then in turn pass on his knowledge to Namikaze Minato, who would become Yondaime Hokage.<br>
              After Yondaime Hokage's death, the Sandaime came out of retirement to lead his village again.<br>

              Many ninja died and Yondaime had to give his life to beat the Kyuubi and imprison him in his newborn son.<br>

              When she met Uzumaki Naruto she thought that he was also going down a foolish path,<br>
              but his hard work and determination inspired her to think that becoming Hokage was a worthwhile thing.<br>

            <li>
              <strong>Danzou[temporary]</strong><br>

              Danzou then made his move to convince the Fire Country Daimyou that he was the best choice to be the next Hokage.<br>
              The Daimyou approved of Danzou through hypnosis, though Danzou did not have the full approval of the Leaf Jounin.<br>

          Jinchūriki (人柱力, literally meaning: Power of Human Sacrifice) are humans that have tailed beasts sealed within them.<br>

    <h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
    <p>
      A millennium ago, the world was terrorised by a rampaging, colossal monster known as the Ten-Tails.<br>
      Eventually, through the combined efforts of the twin brothers, Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki, the Ten-Tails was defeated and sealed within Hagoromo, becoming its jinchūriki.<br>
      Throughout his travels, Hagoromo used the Ten-Tails' power to perform many great deeds and promote peace during his lifetime, causing him to be revered as the "Sage of Six Paths".<br>
      Towards the end of his life, Hagoromo, knowing the Ten-Tails would be unleashed on the world again when he died, split its chakra into nine living entities called the tailed beasts.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Although humanity would for centuries exploit the tailed beasts as sources of power, it would not be until after the establishment of the hidden villages that the practice of creating jinchūriki resumed.<br>
      The new hidden villages, each with their own tailed beasts, started sealing the beasts into selected villagers: in Konohagakure this was done to protect the village from its beast, the Nine-Tails;<br>
      in Sunagakure, the abilities that manifested in their jinchūriki were studied so that non-jinchūriki could replicate them; more often than not, though, <br>
      the jinchūriki were meant to be nothing more than military potential, with little regard for the jinchūriki or even the tailed beast.</p>
    <p>Because of the difficulties involved when learning to control a tailed beast and the history the tailed beast itself may have with a village, jinchūriki are often hated and ostracised by their fellow villagers,<br>
      treated as no different than the beast they contain. Members of Akatsuki report that villages are often glad to be rid of their jinchūriki. However, because a jinchūriki is so valuable an asset,<br>
      it is not in the village's interest to let them be captured or turn into missing-nin. To strengthen the jinchūriki's bond with the village, it is tradition for them to be related to their village's Kage: for example,<br>
      Killer B is the adopted brother of the Fourth Raikage and Gaara is the youngest son of the Fourth Kazekage.</p>
    <p>While many jinchūriki do indeed experience hardship in their early lives, either being mistreated by the majority of the village or dying in their failed attempts to control their tailed beasts,<br>
      some are able to earn respect and recognition both within their village and in the wider world: Gaara and Yagura Karatachi becomes their villages' Kage, while Killer B, Yugito Nii, and Naruto Uzumaki become regarded as heroes and icons of their
      villages,<br>
      with Naruto also becoming a Kage eventually. Fifteen years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto and Killer B are the only two jinchūriki, as a result of the changes that came about.<br>
      After Naruto losing Kurama via the Baryon Mode, Killer B is now the last Jinchūriki in existence.</p>

          Over the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was led by different individuals.<br>
          Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals, all seek to make the world a better place through their own means.<br>
          Each Akatsuki tended to have multiple lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures that protected them.</p>
