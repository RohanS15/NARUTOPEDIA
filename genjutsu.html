    <table>
      <td>
        <p> Genjutsu techniques are the illusion techniques of a ninja,<br>
          they normally require hand seals. Genjutsu will use hypnotism to cause hallucinations in others.<br>
          By causing such illusions they can cause their target mental pain and suffering just as real as physical hurt. <br>
          Genjutsu is created when a ninja extends their chakra flow through the cerebral nervous system of their opponent to control their minds chakra, <br>
          thereby affecting their five senses.</p>
        <p>To combat the effects of Genjutsu, there are two options. <br>
          The first option is for the ninja to stop the flow of chakra in their body,<br>
          and then apply an even stronger power to disrupt the flow of the casters chakra. <br>
          The second option is to have an outside ninja unaffected by the Genjutsu make body contact,<br>
          and use their chakra to disrupt the casters flow.</p>

    <h2>Izanagi - Forefather God</h2>
    <p><strong>Character Use: </strong>Rikudou Sennin, Shimura Danzou, Uchiha Madara</p>
    <table cellspacing="40">
      <td>
        <p>Izanagi, named for a god who helped spawn many islands and deities, is a Genjutsu technique which was declared a Kinjutsu by the Uchiha Clan.<br>
          Using Izanagi grants the user the ability to turn wounds and disadvantages into nothing more than dream. <br>
          It also makes attacks and advantageous maneuvers real, thus giving one complete control over their own reality through an illusion cast on themselves. <br>
          The creative power of Izanagi was first used the Rikudou Sennin. Izanagi uses the mind and spiritual power of Yin to shape reality,<br>
          and the vitality and physical power of Yang to give it life. The Rikudou used that same power to create the Bijuu from the Juubi. <br>
          The Rikudou's powers were passed on to the Uchiha and Senju, and only one containing both of their power can use the jutsu.<br>
        </p>
        <p>When jutsu is cast on one's own self, any damage received while it is active is negated. <br>
          Their crippled form will shudder away like an illusion into nothingness while they appear unharmed away from the danger.<br>
          For those who do not possess the Rinnegan, using the jutsu has a drawback, as using the jutsu will cause their vision to be lost forever. <br>
          This result caused the Uchiha to declare it forbidden.<br></p>
        <p>The jutsu normally has a short time limit which varies from Uchiha clan member to clan member.<br>
          This was extended through the experimentation of Orochimaru, which granted almost a minute of immortality for each eye sacrificed. <br>
          This was used to full effect when ANBU Root leader Danzou had a portion of Senju Hashirama and numerous viable Sharingans implanted in his right arm. <br>
          This extended time was active at the cost of an ongoing drain on Danzou's chakra.<br>
          So when active, it allowed him to absorb numerous fatal attacks at the cost of one of the Sharingan eyes permanently closing on his arm and becoming useless.<br>
          Should Danzou need to conserve chakra and protect the eyes, he would cancel the jutsu and attempt to avoid critical hits.<br></p>

    <h2>Kotoamatsukami - Distinguished Heavenly Gods</h2>
    <p><strong>Character Use: </strong>Uchiha Shisui, Shimura Danzou, Itachi's Crow</p>
    <table>
      <td>
        <p>Kotoamatsukami, named for first of the Japanese gods,<br>
          is a Ninjutsu technique which uses the Mangekyou form of the Sharingan eye to control the minds and opinions of others, without the victim's awareness.<br>
          It is regarded as Uchiha Shisui's ultimate Genjutsu of his Mangekyou eyes. This power helped Shisui be regarded as the most powerful Genjutsu user of the Uchiha.<br>
          His skills were so legendary, that he decided to end his own life for fear his eyes fall into the wrong hands.<br>
          In their normal Mangekyou state, each eye can cast one mind control jutsu approximately every decade.<br>
          No direct eye contact with the victim was needed, as Kotoamatsukami could be cast while still being covered and hidden with cloth. <br>
          However the victim still needed to be within the vicinity.<br>
          Godaime Mizukage regarded Kotoamatsukami as being similar to the jutsu used to <br>
          control her predecessor Yagura by the man known as Tobi.<br></p>
        <p>Shisui's right eye was taken and implanted by ANBU Root leader Danzou.<br>
          With the addition of genetic material from Senju Hashirama, Danzou was able to utilize Kotoamatsukami on a much more frequest basis,<br>
          though not more than once in single day. To that end he used the ability to help him become the <br>
          preliminary Rokudaime Hokage and almost become supreme leader of the shinobi alliance. <br>
          Shisui enrusted his left eye with his friend Uchiha Itachi, who implanted the eye in a crow.<br>
          This crow he later implanted into Naruto, with the added command that upon seeing Itachi's Mangekyou eye again, <br>
          it would cast the command "Protect Konoha" back at the Mangekyou holder.<br>
          Kotoamatsukami was so powerful, that it was able to overlay a new command on Itachi,<br>
          who had been resurrected via Edo Tensei.</p>
