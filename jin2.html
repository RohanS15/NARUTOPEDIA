      <h2>Shukaku</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Shukaku (守鶴, Shukaku), more commonly known as the One-Tail (一尾, Ichibi), <br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Gaara of Sunagakure, <br>
            after being sealed in two other jinchūriki before him.<br></p>
          <p>Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner,<br>
            giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses "ore-sama" (オレ様, literally meaning: my esteemed self) when referring to itself,<br>
            as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences.<br>
            According to Gaara, prior to its introduction, Shukaku relishes the opportunity to kill anyone in sight,<br>
            even more so during a full moon. Shukaku has also shown to harbour a bitter grudge towards Kurama due to the fox's <br>
            beliefs that the tailed beasts' strength is measured by the number of tails, therefore viewing the tanuki as the weakest.<br>
            Because of this, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival.</p>
          <p>Years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Shukaku's relationship with Sunagakure was relatively peaceful <br>
            as it mellowed down. As with the other tailed beasts, Shukaku also came to respect Naruto as well, <br>
            commenting on his son Boruto with interest when he displayed a similar drive. <br>
            Shukaku is also not above developing affection as after Naruto's daughter Himawari risked her own safety to save Shukaku,<br>
            the tanuki began enjoying her company and when finally leaving, bid her a genuine and friendly goodbye.</p>

          <p>Matatabi (又旅, Matatabi), more commonly known as the Two-Tails (ニ尾, Nibi), <br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Yugito Nii of Kumogakure.<br></p>
          <p>Compared to most of the tailed beasts, Matatabi has shown to be respectful and polite towards others, speaking in a formal manner using "watashi" <br>
            (私) when referring to itself and using honourifics when addressing Naruto while introducing itself to the young shinobi.</p>

      <h2>Isobu</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Isobu (磯撫, Isobu), more commonly known as the Three-Tails <br>
            (三尾, Sanbi), is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Yagura Karatachi of Kirigakure.<br></p>
          <p>Isobu primarily resembles a large turtle, but with a crab-like shell, spikes all over its body,<br>
            and three shrimp-like tails. Under its shell, it has red, muscle-like tissue.<br>
            It has a pair of human-like arms and hands, but no hind-legs. <br>
            His face is concealed between a large forehead and lower jaw — both of which have spikes.<br>
            Its eyes are red and have crimson pupils. In the anime, the eyes are red with yellow pupils.</p>
          <p>Its right eye is constantly closed. In the anime, Guren speculated this was because its eyes <br>
            were the only soft parts of its body, being heavily-armoured, and thus kept one eye closed <br>
            to cover more vulnerable spots. During the last remaining days of the Sage of Six Paths, <br>
            Isobu was essentially much the same in appearance, albeit smaller in size with shorter <br>
            spikes around its body, but was still many times larger than the Sage.</p>

      <h2>Son Gokū</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Seiten Taisei Son Gokū (斉天大聖孫悟空), more commonly known as Son Gokū (孫悟空) or simply the Four-Tails <br>
            (四尾, Yonbi), is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Rōshi of Iwagakure.<br></p>
          <p>Son Gokū is a very prideful tailed beast, as it detests being called by the name <br>
            "Four-Tails" and boasts about its lineage. It uses "ore" (オレ) when referring to itself.</p>
          <p>It also hated humans, due to the fact that humans had enslaved it, and believes that apes are more intelligent than humans.<br>
            However, when talking about the Sage of Six Paths, it showed him great respect, being that also had, apparently, <br>
            a very deep relationship with him, never forgetting his final words. It also seems to have taken a liking to Naruto Uzumaki, <br>
            as it was moved by his actions for truly trying to save it from being controlled by Tobi and even gave <br>
            him some of its chakra before being sealed away. He also treats his fellow tailed beasts with much respect,<br>
            as he addresses them by their name, as seen with Kurama. Son also has a high amount of respect for those who respect the tailed beasts.</p>

      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Kokuō (穆王, Kokuō), more commonly known as the Five-Tails (五尾, Gobi),<br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Han from Iwagakur<br></p>
          <p>Kokuō seems to be a quiet and reserved individual. <br>
            Though it does not speak much, Kokuō uses the rather old-fashioned "watakushi" (私) when referring to itself, <br>
            causing it to come across as very polite. It also has pride as a tailed beast,<br>
            being dismayed at being controlled and being used as Tobi's puppet during the Fourth Shinobi World War. <br>
            After the end of the war, Kokuō declared that it wants to seclude itself in the forest, <br>
            which implies it is a pacifistic individual, not wanting confrontations anymore.</p>

      <h2>Saiken</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Saiken (犀犬, Saiken), more commonly known as the Six-Tails (六尾, Rokubi), <br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Utakata of Kirigakure.<br></p>
          <p>Though much has not been seen of Saiken's personality, the giant slug uses "ore" (オレ) <br>
            when referring to itself, "ore" being a boastful way of saying "I".<br>
            It also speaks with a dialect which may possibly be Ōsakaben in origin. In the anime,<br>
            Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts,<br>
            as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply;<br>
            and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over.<br>
            However, it was not above killing for self-preservation, as seen when it killed Harusame when <br>
            he attempted to extract it from its jinchūriki. In the anime,<br>
            it speaks with a high pitched voice and appears to be very energetic.</p>

          <p>Chōmei (重明, Chōmei), more commonly known as the Seven-Tails (七尾, Nanabi, Shichibi),<br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It was last sealed within Fū from Takigakure.<br></p>
          <p>Chōmei seems to have a happy-go-lucky personality — which it seemingly shares with <br>
            its jinchūriki as shown when it introduced itself to Naruto,<br>
            referring to itself as "Lucky Seven Chōmei" (ラッキーセブン重明, Rakkī sebun Chōmei), <br>
            which might be an allusion to the fact that it has seven tails and the number seven <br>
            having long been seen as a lucky as well as a happy number.<br>
            It also had a habit of using the word lucky in conversation, reflecting its personality.[7]</p>

      <h2>Gyūki</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Gyūki (牛鬼, Gyūki), more commonly known as the Eight-Tails (八尾, Hachibi),<br>
            is one of the nine tailed beasts. It has been in the possession of Kumogakure for decades,<br>
            where it has been sealed into many jinchūriki. Its most recent jinchūriki,<br>
            and the first to have any success in cooperating with it, is Killer B.<br></p>
          <p>Gyūki is characterised as a tough and serious individual.<br>
            It uses "ore" (オレ) when referring to itself and often speaks in a somewhat rude dialect. <br>
            Gyūki was also shown to have a good analytical ability, as it told Killer B that if he left Ponta and Sabu and ran away from them,<br>
            Kisame Hoshigaki and his water dome would follow him and they (Sabu and Ponta) would be freed.<br>
            Although Gyūki mentioned that it and its brethren disliked Kurama for its arrogance and belief that their strength are based on their number of tails,<br>
            it insisted that was no reason for not helping Naruto Uzumaki to control Kurama's power, hinting a benevolent side.<br>
            Since then, both Gyūki and B have taken a liking to Naruto.</p>
          <p>In the past, Gyūki was infamous in Kumo for being wild and violent,<br>
            as it went on countless rampages whenever its former jinchūriki would lose control of it.<br>
            This was most likely due to its hatred against humans for oppressing and sealing it away many times.<br>
            Gyūki maintained this behaviour until it was sealed within B, <br>
            who would later change it after he bested it in one-on-one combat.<br>
            Since then, Gyūki's personality has become much more relaxed, becoming close friends with B;<br>
            even allowing him to sit on top of its muzzle while talking to it leisurely.<br>
            However, B tends to annoy Gyūki to comical effect, as its no-nonsense demeanour often contrasts with B's <br>
            tendency to goof off whenever he likes, adding fuel to Gyūki's irritation to its vessel.</p>
          <p>As a result, Gyūki is not above bad-mouthing B and is also known to reprimand him in serious occasions.<br>
            This was seen when Gyūki criticised B for rapping in his fight with Kisame when he should have been completely focused on their opponent,<br>
            and later when it comically bumped B in the head when the latter started to mention in a perverted manner how Yugito's black receivers were <br>
            embedded in her left breast and when Obito disappeared B was wondering if he escaped only for Gyūki to tell B to find him.<br>
            This somewhat contradicts the original point of having a jinchūriki which is to control a tailed beast, <br>
            but Gyūki seems to be more of the one in control than B. Because of this, Gyūki appears to be much more noteworthy <br>
            than B as far as responsibility is concerned. Nonetheless, Gyūki formed a very strong bond with B, <br>
            as even after being extracted from its jinchūriki, the tailed beast severed a piece of itself to help sustain B's life.<br>
            Following its release from Kaguya, Gyūki expressed a desire to return to B, <br>
            noting it had gotten used to his awful rapping and felt odd not hearing it.</p>

      <h2>Kurama</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>Kurama (九喇嘛, Kurama), more commonly known as the Nine-Tails (九尾, Kyūbi),<br>
             was one of the nine tailed beasts. Centuries of being regarded as a mindless monster <br>
             and sought after as a tool for war caused Kurama to hate humans. <br>
             After being sealed into Naruto Uzumaki, Kurama attempts to maintain its cynical perspective about the world,<br>
              but with Naruto's insistence on treating it with respect, the fox overturns its hatred and willingly <br>
              strives to use its power for the world's salvation.<br></p>
              <p>Kurama is characterised as a snarky and shrewd individual. <br>
                It uses "washi" (ワシ) when referring to itself, which is generally used by older men.<br>
                 Kurama expresses great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the tailed beasts <br>
                  due to its belief that their strength is determined by their number of tails, <br>
                  which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku.<br>
                   It does react out of jealously whenever Naruto uses a power other than its own.<br>
                   Conversely, Kurama openly acknowledged the fact that it alone doesn't stand a chance against the Ten-Tails,<br>
                   and from its past experience with Madara, knew full well he is not an opponent to be underestimated, <br>
                   even though he was seemingly pushed into a corner at the time.<br>
                    Kurama holds great respect to Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, as it was shown during the tailed beasts' <br>
                    youth that the fox shed tears after the Sage had imparted his final words to them.<br>
                    Kurama's manner of speech is often harsh, but deep down it has a supportive disposition, <br>
                    as the fox does express concern about its comrades, and even gave some words of encouragement to Kawaki.</p>
                    <p>Centuries of receiving humanity's negative treatment caused Kurama to develop intense hostility and distrust against them,<br>
                       even going as far as proclaiming itself to be the living embodiment of hatred.<br>
                       Ever since its sealing within Naruto, Kurama plotted to use his dependence on its power to break free from the seal.<br>
                        Eventually, after Naruto managed to best Kurama in combat,the young shinobi then told the fox that he hoped to resolve its hatred someday.<br>
                         Despite audibly reproaching him for making such a claim, Kurama nevertheless had developed a level of respect for Naruto and his determination, <br>
                         even noting that he was different from the humans it had previously encountered, therefore allowing its jinchūriki to utilise the Nine-Tails <br>
                         Chakra Mode without consequence during the early stages of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Later on, as Naruto told Son Gokū of his desire to save <br>
                         the tailed beasts and become friends with Kurama,[33] the fox — having witnessed all of the hardships and deeds Naruto had in his life <br>
                          — stood by to see if he could truly aid its brethren through his actions.<br>
                          When Naruto successfully freed Son Gokū from Obito's control, Kurama finally became convinced of Naruto's <br>
                          word and offered to meld its chakra with his as a coalition, to which Naruto then removed the seal that restrained <br>
                          it and happily acknowledged the fox as his teammate and a member of Konoha.[35]</p>

      <h2>Ten Tails</h2>
      <table>
        <td>
          <p>This Ten-Tails (十尾, Jūbi) is the combined form of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki and the God Tree,<br>
             created to reclaim the chakra inherited by her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura. <br>
             It is regarded as the progenitor of chakra, and is tied to the legend of the Sage <br>
             of Six Paths and the birth of shinobi. To end the beast's rampage, the Sage became the <br>
              Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and later split its chakra into the nine tailed beasts to prevent it <br>
              from causing further harm. Centuries later, its revival became the objective of Madara and Obito Uchiha,<br>
               who both sought to become the beast's jinchūriki in order to further their objectives.<br></p>
               <p>According to Kurama, the Ten-Tails cannot be sensed through such means as detecting negative emotions <br>
                 as it has no feelings or ideals of its own.[9] Despite this, when it sensed the presence of the tailed beasts' <br>
                 chakra inside Naruto Uzumaki and was reminded of Hagoromo, it reacted by gathering chakra and strengthening itself.<br>
                  It was believed that the Ten-Tails was an incarnation of the God Tree with the singular goal of regathering the chakra that Kaguya had stolen from it,<br>
                   but in actuality, it was following Kaguya's will to reclaim all chakra for herself.[4]</p>
