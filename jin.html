  <h1><strong>Sealing</strong></h1>
  <hr>
    <p>
      Jinchūriki typically have their tailed beasts sealed into them early in their lives - often shortly after birth <br>
      - so that they can grow up acclimating to their beast. Which seal is used differs from village to village,<br>
      with Konoha using the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style and Kumo using the Iron Armour Seal.<br>
      In order for a jinchūriki to be successful in the long term, it is important for the jinchūriki to have special compatibility <br>
      or simply unique chakra that can improve their chances.If a jinchūriki has been one for a long time,<br>
      their chakra will naturally adapt to their tailed beast for better compatibility.<br>
      In the case of the Ten-Tails, it is also necessary that its jinchūriki have a living body.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are several ways in which a tailed beast can be removed from its jinchūriki.<br>
      If the jinchūriki loses control of the beast or if the seal is simply allowed to weaken enough,<br>
      the beast will be released. For female jinchūriki, seals are at their weakest during childbirth,<br>
      due to the nurturing of the child in the womb taking precedence over the reinforcement of the seal. As such, <br>
      another ninja is required to keep the seal intact during childbirth and restore it to full power afterwards.<br>
      Akatsuki uses the Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals to extract the tailed beasts and seal <br>
      them within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path for future use.</p>

    <p>Typically, the removal of a tailed beast will cause immediate death for a jinchūriki.<br>
      Two jinchūriki from the Uzumaki clan, however, have been shown to survive the initial removal of their tailed beast,<br>
      but they are left severely weakened and/or left in a critical state.<br>
      If a jinchūriki is able to hold on to or receive some of their beast's chakra,<br>
      that will also enable them to survive. The Ten-Tails' jinchūriki can survive its removal so long as the Demonic Statue remains within them,<br>
      though they will be completely paralysed for a time.[15] Reincarnated jinchūriki can "survive" their <br>
      beast's removal since they are already dead, but they may lose consciousness in the process.</p>

    <h1><strong>Abilities</strong></h1>
    <p>A jinchūriki has access to their tailed beast's massive chakra reserves.<br>
      Most jinchūriki learn how to access this chakra on their own and take it by force,<br>
      but they can also form a symbiosis with their tailed beast and take only what chakra is offered to them.<br>
      A tailed beast may even give chakra to its jinchūriki without them knowing it, either to try and exert control over the jinchūriki, <br>
      or simply to protect the jinchūriki and, by extension, itself. If a jinchūriki shares a good relationship with their tailed beast,<br>
      they can have the beast in question to help them cancel a genjutsu for them.</p>
    <p>In addition to the chakra reserves, jinchūriki gain abilities unique to the respective beast. <br>
      As the jinchūriki transform themselves into the likeness of their tailed beasts,<br>
      it further increases the power of their abilities. If they are able to survive their beast's removal,<br>
      they will still have access to those abilities.</p>

    <h1><strong>Control</strong></h1>
    <p>The jinchūriki have the potential to control their tailed beasts' power,<br>
      but require intense training and sheer willpower in order to properly wield it.<br>
      According to Gerotora, whenever the jinchūriki draws out a certain amount of the tailed beasts' chakra,<br>
      the beasts' very own psyche will fuse along with it, which usually involves an inner struggle between <br>
      them as the jinchūriki goes deeper into their tailed beasts' forms. <br>
      If a jinchūriki were to completely give into its influence, <br>
      the seal will break and the tailed beast will be released.<br>
      For the jinchūriki to have complete control, they must find something to fill in the <br>
      void of loneliness within their hearts to give them strength.</p>

    <p>Jinchūriki that have tamed their tailed beast can summon it outside of their bodies while retaining enough <br>
      of their tailed beast's chakra to avoid suffering the effects of death or critical condition that comes <br>
      with a tailed beast extraction to fight on their behalf. <br>
      Afterwards, the tailed beast has to either be resealed or is de-summoned back into the jinchūriki.</p>
