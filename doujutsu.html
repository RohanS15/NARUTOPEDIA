    <h2>Izanagi - Forefather God</h2>
    <p><strong>Character Use: </strong>Rikudou Sennin, Shimura Danzou, Uchiha Madara</p>
    <table cellspacing="40">
      <td>
        <p>Izanagi, named for a god who helped spawn many islands and deities, is a Genjutsu technique which was declared a Kinjutsu by the Uchiha Clan.<br>
          Using Izanagi grants the user the ability to turn wounds and disadvantages into nothing more than dream. <br>
          It also makes attacks and advantageous maneuvers real, thus giving one complete control over their own reality through an illusion cast on themselves. <br>
          The creative power of Izanagi was first used the Rikudou Sennin. Izanagi uses the mind and spiritual power of Yin to shape reality,<br>
          and the vitality and physical power of Yang to give it life. The Rikudou used that same power to create the Bijuu from the Juubi. <br>
          The Rikudou's powers were passed on to the Uchiha and Senju, and only one containing both of their power can use the jutsu.<br>
        </p>
        <p>When jutsu is cast on one's own self, any damage received while it is active is negated. <br>
          Their crippled form will shudder away like an illusion into nothingness while they appear unharmed away from the danger.<br>
          For those who do not possess the Rinnegan, using the jutsu has a drawback, as using the jutsu will cause their vision to be lost forever. <br>
          This result caused the Uchiha to declare it forbidden.<br></p>
        <p>The jutsu normally has a short time limit which varies from Uchiha clan member to clan member.<br>
          This was extended through the experimentation of Orochimaru, which granted almost a minute of immortality for each eye sacrificed. <br>
          This was used to full effect when ANBU Root leader Danzou had a portion of Senju Hashirama and numerous viable Sharingans implanted in his right arm. <br>
          This extended time was active at the cost of an ongoing drain on Danzou's chakra.<br>
          So when active, it allowed him to absorb numerous fatal attacks at the cost of one of the Sharingan eyes permanently closing on his arm and becoming useless.<br>
          Should Danzou need to conserve chakra and protect the eyes, he would cancel the jutsu and attempt to avoid critical hits.<br></p>

        <p>Amaterasu, named for the Goddess of the Sun, is a Ninjutsu technique which uses the Mangekyou form of the Sharingan eye to create a powerful black fire.<br>
           This jutsu is generated by the right Mangekyou eye. It has been said that anything within the Mangekyou's vision will burn to ash if consumed by the fire.<br>
            The fire itself is said to burn for 7 days and 7 nights. Because of the amount of chakra needed to use the technique, <br>
            it can only be used on a very limited basis daily. Though it is regarded as the strongest of Mangekyou's physical attacks,<br>
             usage of the ability will degrade the eye further and lead the user to blindness.<br></p>

        <p>Kamui is a Ninjutsu technique which uses the Mangekyou Sharingan eye to generate an imploding transportation vortex.<br>
           To begin Kakashi forms a handseal to change his normal three tomoe Sharingan into a new Mangekyou form.<br>
            He then focuses on an area of his target. The surrounding area will then warp and collapse in on itself, <br>
            quickly reducing the surrounding area to nothingness. The technique will transport the focused area away to another location. <br>
            The technique caused a huge strain on Kakashi, utilizing a great deal of chakra. He was able to use the technique <br>
             twice in succession and then revert back to three tomoe. It is unknown how many times he could use it before total exertion.<br></p>

    <h2>Kotoamatsukami - Distinguished Heavenly Gods</h2>

    <table>
      <td>
        <p>Kotoamatsukami, named for first of the Japanese gods,<br>
          is a Ninjutsu technique which uses the Mangekyou form of the Sharingan eye to control the minds and opinions of others, without the victim's awareness.<br>
          It is regarded as Uchiha Shisui's ultimate Genjutsu of his Mangekyou eyes. This power helped Shisui be regarded as the most powerful Genjutsu user of the Uchiha.<br>
          His skills were so legendary, that he decided to end his own life for fear his eyes fall into the wrong hands.<br>
          In their normal Mangekyou state, each eye can cast one mind control jutsu approximately every decade.<br>
          No direct eye contact with the victim was needed, as Kotoamatsukami could be cast while still being covered and hidden with cloth. <br>
          However the victim still needed to be within the vicinity.<br>
          Godaime Mizukage regarded Kotoamatsukami as being similar to the jutsu used to <br>
          control her predecessor Yagura by the man known as Tobi.<br></p>
        <p>Shisui's right eye was taken and implanted by ANBU Root leader Danzou.<br>
          With the addition of genetic material from Senju Hashirama, Danzou was able to utilize Kotoamatsukami on a much more frequest basis,<br>
          though not more than once in single day. To that end he used the ability to help him become the <br>
          preliminary Rokudaime Hokage and almost become supreme leader of the shinobi alliance. <br>
          Shisui enrusted his left eye with his friend Uchiha Itachi, who implanted the eye in a crow.<br>
          This crow he later implanted into Naruto, with the added command that upon seeing Itachi's Mangekyou eye again, <br>
          it would cast the command "Protect Konoha" back at the Mangekyou holder.<br>
          Kotoamatsukami was so powerful, that it was able to overlay a new command on Itachi,<br>
          who had been resurrected via Edo Tensei.</p>

          <p>Tsukuyomi, named for the God of the Moon, is a Genjutsu technique which uses the Mangekyou <br>
            form of the Sharingan eye to generate a powerful illusion. This jutsu is generated by the left Mangekyou eye.<br>
            This highly advanced technique can not be used extensively because of the toll it places on the user.<br>
            To utilize the illusion, the clan member will look into the eyes of his opponent and cast a Genjutsu spell on them.<br>
            The illusion takes place in the mind of the one affected, while under the jutsu the victim is at the total mercy of the user.<br>
            The user has full control over space and time in the jutsu and can place the one affected through any hell they desire for any length desired. <br>
            The technique itself only lasts for but a second in reality, but the one affected could have lasted through several days of torture.<br></p>

             sword wielding spectral form which will surround the user. <br>
             This jutsu is generated by both Mangekyou eyes. Susanoo will first form around the user as a skeleton. <br>
             This skeletal form will then generate muscle and armor for battle and wield both a sword and shield.<br></p>
             <p>The sword is formed out of the sake in the gourd it holds, meaning the sword has no true physical form. <br>
               This legendary weapon, known as the Totsuka no Tsurugi (Ten Hands Sword) and the Sakegari no Tachi (Sake Cutting Long Sword), <br>
               utilizes the main ability of the jutsu. Anyone or anything cut by the blade will be sealed away into a <br>
               Genjutsu of blissful oblivion until the end of time. The shield is known as Yata no Kagami (Eight Span Mirror). <br>
               It is said this shield can defend against any attack. Together the sword and shield will make the Susanoo user nearly invincible. <br>
               Like other Mangekyou techniques, usage of Susanoo will damages the eyes and health of the user unless they have Eternal Mangekyou.<br></p>
