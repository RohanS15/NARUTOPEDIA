        <p>Ninjutsu (忍術, English TV: Ninja Art, literally meaning: Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main jutsu categories. <br>
          Ninjutsu is the most nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not genjutsu or taijutsu.<br>
          Most ninjutsu require chakra and hand seals, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of weaponry qualifies as ninjutsu.<br>
          The huge range of ninjutsu's uses is illustrated by its several sub-classifications: medical ninjutsu, <br>
          eincarnation ninjutsu, space–time ninjutsu, barrier ninjutsu, sealing jutsu, cursed seal jutsu and sensory ninjutsu.<br></p>
        <p>Most ninjutsu use shape transformation, which deals with controlling the form and movement of the ninjutsu,<br>
          while nature transformation deals with changing the ninjutsu's physical properties.<br>
          Ninjutsu that use nature transformation tend to follow a naming convention of their nature type followed by a more specific name.<br>
          With practice and experience, certain ninjutsu can become second nature to a ninja, allowing them to perform it at will.<br></p>
        <p>Ninjutsu is humans' corrupted use of the Sage of the Six Paths' ninshū originally created by his son, Indra;<br>
          ather than use chakra to achieve understanding and create peace as the Sage intended, humans weaponised their chakra for war. <br>
          Over time, shinobi came to believe that Hagoromo was the inventor of the ninjutsu rather than his eldest son.<br></p>
