        <p> Taijutsu techniques are the body and hand to hand skills of the ninja. <br>
          Taijutsu techniques do not require hand seals. Instead the ninja will train their body in different forms of fighting.<br>
          A ninja can also use their inherent Bloodline abilities when doing Taijutsu techniques.<br>
          Clans such as Hyuuga can utilize their ability to see the inner chakra channels of their opponent and then stop the flow,<br>
          or utilize the Kaiten technique to form a protective barrier by releasing chakra from their body.<br></p>
