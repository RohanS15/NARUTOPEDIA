        <p>Fūinjutsu (封印術, English TV: Sealing Jutsu, literally meaning: Sealing Techniques) are a type of jutsu that seal <br>
          objects, living beings, chakra, along with a wide variety of other things within another object. <br>
          Fūinjutsu can also be used to restrict movement or unseal objects either from within something or someone.<br>
          The presence of a seal is marked by the appearance of formations of technique formulae, kanji,<br>
          or else other kinds of symbols (likewise with Summoning Techniques).<br>
          A unison of barrier ninjutsu and fūinjutsu is referred to as a "Sealing Barrier" (封印結界, Fūin Kekkai).<br>
          In a similar fashion to genjutsu, fūinjutsu can be undone by combining specific seals with <br>
          a Fūinjutsu: Release (封印術・解, Fūinjutsu: Kai, literally meaning: Sealing Technique: Release) command.<br></p>
        <p>Fuuinjutsu techniques are the Ninjutsu sealing techniques of the ninja. <br>
          They allow the ninja to contain the elements and demons.<br></p>

    <h2>Bijuu (Tailed Beast) Attachment (Chiyo Version - Unnamed)</h2>
    <p><strong>Character Use: </strong>Chiyo</p>
    <table>
      <td>
        <p>This unnamed Fuuinjutsu technique attached the Shukaku Ichibi to Gaara's unborn body. <br>
          Shukaku was attached to two Sand ninja previously by Chiyo, presumably using this same technique.<br>
          To attach the demon, the technique must bring the two beings into synch, both bijuu and human.<br>
          As a consequence of the attachment, Gaara's mother Karura lost her life.<br>
          Akatsuki has termed the attachment of demons to an individual and the resulting loss of life a "Jinchuuriki," literally "the power of human sacrifice."<br>
          Such a technique will grant the human portions of the demons power. <br>
          Kazekage hoped this would create an ultimate ninja, who would have near unlimited chakra from the demon.<br>
          As a result of Shukaku's attachment, the demon protects Gaara with nearby sand.<br></p>

    <h2>Fuuja Houin - Evil Sealing Method</h2>
    <p><strong>Character Use: </strong>Hatake Kakashi</p>
    <table>
      <td>
        <p>Fuuja Houin is a Fuuinjutsu used to counter-act the effects of a cursed seal. <br>
          The ninja writes the needed seal characters on the ground and body of the person cursed with the seal.<br>
          The ninja then forms the needed hand seals and places his hand over the cursed seal and then activates the written seal. <br>
          The seal characters will then retreat to surround the cursed seal in a circular seal. <br>
          Though the Fuuja Houin can work well against lesser seals, it will not be able to fully <br>
          stop a cursed seal placed by a powerful, skilled ninja.<br></p>

           absorb the substance of incoming attacks. <br>
          This seal will absorb both plain chakra and elemental attacks.<br>
           He does this by reversing his chakra flow to draw the external <br>
           attack deep within his body and nullify it.<br></p>

        <p>Fuuka Houin is a Fuuinjutsu that allows the ninja to seal away a nearby fire. <br>
          After unrolling a scroll to hold the fire, the ninja writes the needed sealing incantation onto the scroll.<br>
           Then by forming the needed handseals, a vapor will emanate from the scroll to encompass <br>
            the fire and take it back to the scroll for sealing.<br></p>

        <p>Gogyou Fuuin is a Fuuinjutsu used by the Sannin Orochimaru.<br>
           Orochimaru forms an elemental seal on each of his fingers,<br>
            one for each of the following five "elements": water, metal, earth, fire and wood. <br>
            He used this odd numbered seal to disrupt the affects of the even <br>
             numbered Shishou Fuuin placed on Naruto's stomach by the Fourth Hokage. <br>
              The Gogyou Fuuin would disrupt the Shishou Fuuin's ability to let the <br>
               Kyuubi's chakra blend into Naruto's chakra..<br></p>

        <p>Hakke no Fuuin Shiki was a Fuuinjutsu used by the Fourth Hokage. <br>
          The Hakke no Fuuin Shiki was used in conjunction with the Shiki Fuujin technique <br>
          to seal the Kyuubi demon within the stomach of Naruto. <br>
          The Hakke no Fuuin Shiki allows the two Shishou Fuuin to leak the <br>
           Kyuubi chakra back into Naruto's own chakra.<br></p>
